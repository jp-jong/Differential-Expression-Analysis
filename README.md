# Differential-Expression-Analysis

The dataset used in this analysis came from the study of Kokina et al. (2022) on Purine starvation of yeast:

Kokina A, Tanilas K, Ozolina Z, Pleiko K, Shvirksts K, Vamza I, Liepins J. Purine Auxotrophic Starvation Evokes Phenotype Similar to Stationary Phase Cells in Budding Yeast. J Fungi (Basel). 2021 Dec 29;8(1):29. doi: 10.3390/jof8010029. PMID: 35049969; PMCID: PMC8780165.

All data were analysed and visualized in R. For more information on the context and workflow of this analysis, please view the ppt file. Sample plots and the code to generate these plots can be accessed through the plots and scripts folder, respectively.

RNA-seq reads from yeast samples grown in two different conditions: medium with synthetic dextrose (+) and (-) without source of Adenine, were obtained.
